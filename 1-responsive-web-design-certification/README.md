## Responsive Web Design Certification

In this course, I learned the basics of **HTML** and **CSS**. I progressed in understanding how to structure a web page with **HTML**, becoming familiar with basic header tags like `h1` and `h2`, creating paragraphs using the `<p>` tag, and using semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`. I also learned to separate page sections using the `<section>` tag, understand basic `form` tags, and insert `images`, `videos`, and other elements.

With **CSS**, I learned to define `variables`, use `media queries`, work with `CSS flexbox` and `CSS grid` properties, and understand other important properties like `position` and `display`.

All the projects in this certification were executed by applying these concepts exclusively using **HTML** and **CSS**.
