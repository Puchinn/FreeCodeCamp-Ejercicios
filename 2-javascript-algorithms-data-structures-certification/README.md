## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification

In this course, I learned about data types such as `numbers`, `strings`, `booleans`, `dates`, etc. I learned the different ways to define variables (`var`, `let`, `const`) and their distinctions. I covered conditional logic, including statements like `if`, `else if`, `else`, and `switch`. Additionally, I gained knowledge about loops such as `for`, `for in`, `for of`, `while`, and `do while`, iterating over `arrays`, and understanding `objects` structures.
